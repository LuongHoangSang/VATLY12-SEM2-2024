I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
here. If you just want an ampersand, the remedy is
simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.

I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
here. If you just want an ampersand, the remedy is
simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.

I've put in what seems to be necessary to fix
the current column of the current alignment.
Try to go on, since this might almost work.

A forbidden control sequence occurred in skipped text.
This kind of error happens when you say `\if...' and forget
the matching `\fi'. I've inserted a `\fi'; this might work.

! Missing $ inserted.
<inserted text>

I've inserted a begin-math/end-math symbol since I think
you left one out. Proceed, with fingers crossed.

You have given more \span or & marks than there were
in the preamble to the \halign or \valign now in progress.
So I'll assume that you meant to type \cr instead.

A forbidden control sequence occurred in skipped text.
This kind of error happens when you say `\if...' and forget
the matching `\fi'. I've inserted a `\fi'; this might work.

! Missing $ inserted.

I've inserted a begin-math/end-math symbol since I think
you left one out. Proceed, with fingers crossed.

! Extra alignment tab has been changed to \cr.

You have given more \span or & marks than there were
in the preamble to the \halign or \valign now in progress.
So I'll assume that you meant to type \cr instead.

Displays can use special alignments (like \eqalignno)
only if nothing but the alignment itself is between $$'s.

here. If you just want an ampersand, the remedy is
simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace

you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.
